# HTML Decorator Example

Demo for an example of using a decorator design pattern

See the [src/demo.php](https://github.com/RidRack/decoratorDesignPattern/blob/master/src/demo.php) file and run via command line PHP for a demo of this code running.

The output should be something like:

```
Start Decorator Test
Blog Title: Decorator Pattern
Blog Decorator After Italic: <i>Decorator Pattern</i>
Blog Decorator after Bold : <b><i>Decorator Pattern</i></b>
showing title after reset: Decorator Pattern
End Decorator Test
```
